// Dynamically Typing

// javascript is a dynamic language
// Two types of languages
// 1.Static (statically typed) meaning if a variable is declared it can not change e.g string name = "Ahneeka"
// 2.Dynamic (Dynamically typed) meaning if a variable is declared it can be changed a anytime e.g let name = "Ahneeka"

let name = "Ahneeka";
let age = 19;
let isApproved = false;
let lastName;
let selectedColor = null;

// i use typeof in the console
