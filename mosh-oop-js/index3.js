// Inheritance; it helps in the elemination of redundant code 

// think of html element like textBox,select,checkbox. All this element have few things in common they should have properties like hidden, innerHTML and methods like click(),focus()  instead of redefining all these methods and properties for every type of html element we can define it once in a generic object and call it HTMLElement and have other objects inherit this properties and methods
