    <h1>About Ahneeka's Journey In SMC</h1>
    <p> 
        Hey there,i'm Ahneeka, i've been learning on how to becoming a software developer @ Semicolon.African.i'm far from an excellent developer, but i've definitely learned somethings about being an average one.Here are some
        lessons i've learned that i think every developer, especially new developers, needs to know.
        <ol>
        <li> <strong>No one knows everything:</strong>
              No developer knows everything and you don't need to know everything. There is so much more to being a developer than knowing by heart,for example, the methods of manipulating arrays.It doesn't matter if you know the little things,
        they are a google search away if you forget them. There are far more important things you can do as a developer to improve yourself than learning these tiny insignificant details like,
        <ul> 
          <li>Focusing on writhing clean efficient code</li>
          <li>Creating awesome project to showcase your work</li>
        </ul>
        The great thing about being a developer is that you don't need to know everything. You only need to know how to <strong>SOLVE PROBLEMS.</strong>
        </li>
       <li>  <strong> Bugs is essential to learning:</strong>
              If you're programming something and you're not coming across any bugs,it means you're learning nothing.Not running into bugs does not mean that you're somehow a great developer because you're too smart to make a mistake.It means that you're 
              already developed something similar, so many times, that you already know how not to run into the bugs.
              Note that when you're solving bugs you are becoming a strong developer. There are endless bugs in development, so the faster you can learn to handle,the better off you'll be.</li>
              
        <li> <strong>Googling is a legitimate skill:</strong>
              If you want to be a great developer, you will need to enhance your googling ability. It's essential to be able to find solutions and code that you are looking for.There is frequent googling,especially when you're learning a brand new technology.</li>
        <li> <strong> Thinking rather than coding:</strong>
              When you're coding, do you ask yourself,"what's the best way to write this code?". I know i usually don't until after i've written a subpar solution. far too often, i find myself writing the solution that first popped into my head. Most of the time,
        the first solution to the problem isn't the best.You need to take the time to come up with a good stable solution.</li>
